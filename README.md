# Cornway-Game-of-Life-SDL2
 This implementation of Cornways's Game of Life uses the SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf libraries to render the game.
 This is an evolution of my original [Cornway's Game of Life - CMD][1] version that used the command prompt to print the cells through ASCII characters. This new version is more performance friendly and less platform dependent.
 The main.cpp file includes a pre-loaded pattern (Goosper glider gun) that can only be modified by modifying the code. Currently the pattern is disabled (commented). 
 Side note: I'm a student, so don't expect much from this program.
