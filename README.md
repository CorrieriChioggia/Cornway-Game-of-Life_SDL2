# Cornway-Game-of-Life-SDL2
 This implementation of Cornways's Game of Life uses the SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf libraries to render the game.
 This is an evolution of my original [Cornway's Game of Life - CMD][1] version that used the command prompt to print the cells through ASCII characters. This new version is more performance friendly and less platform dependent (can be also compiled an ran on Linux).
 The main.cpp file includes a pre-written pattern (Goosper glider gun) that can only be loaded/modified by modifying the code. Currently the pattern is disabled (commented).
